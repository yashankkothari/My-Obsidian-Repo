## **1. Understanding Assets in Information Security**

*   **Definition:** An **asset** in information security is anything valuable to an organization or individual that requires protection.
*   Assets encompass **hardware, software, and data**.

### **1.1. Asset Valuation: Replaceability & Importance**
Assets can be categorized based on how easily they can be replaced (**replaceability**) and their value (**importance**).

*   **Off-the-Shelf Assets:**
    *   **Easily replaceable** with commercially available alternatives (e.g., standard desktop PC, common software like Microsoft Word).
    *   Lower risk impact if lost, but replacement still requires time/effort for setup and configuration.
*   **Unique Assets:**
    *   **Irreplaceable** or extremely difficult/costly to recreate (e.g., proprietary research data, unique source code, personal photos).
    *   Loss can have severe financial, operational, reputational, or emotional consequences.

### **1.2. Types of Assets**

*   **Hardware:** Physical components.
    *   **Computer:** Desktops, laptops, servers.
    *   **Devices:** Storage (HDDs, SSDs), Memory (RAM), Printers, Scanners, Mobile Devices.
    *   **Network gear:** Routers, Switches, Modems, Firewalls (hardware), Cables.
*   **Software:** Programs enabling system functionality.
    *   **Operating system (OS):** Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android. Manages hardware.
    *   **Utilities:** Security tools (**Antivirus, Firewalls**), maintenance tools (**Backup software**, disk cleaners).
    *   **Commercial applications:** Productivity suites (MS Office), design software (Adobe Creative Suite), specific business software (CRM, ERP).
    *   **Individual applications:** Custom-developed software for specific needs, scripts.
*   **Data:** The information itself; often the **most critical and irreplaceable** digital asset.
    *   **Documents:** Reports, spreadsheets, personal notes, academic papers.
    *   **Photos:** Personal memories, professional photography portfolios.
    *   **Music, videos:** Entertainment files, creative works.
    *   **Email:** Communications, attachments, contact lists.
    *   **Class projects / Research Data:** Academic work, experimental results, intellectual property.

*   `[Brief Summary]:` Assets are anything valuable needing protection, categorized by replaceability. Hardware is the physical gear, Software runs on it, and Data is the information itself ‚Äì often the most crucial asset.

*   `‚ùì Thought-Provoking Question:` How might the valuation of the *same* asset (e.g., a laptop) differ between a student and a large corporation? What factors influence this?
*   `üîó Connections:` Asset identification and valuation are the first steps in **Risk Management**. The value assigned to an asset directly influences how much effort and budget should be allocated to protect it.
*   `üåç Real-World Example:` A hospital's **Patient Health Information (PHI)** is a unique, highly valuable data asset requiring stringent protection due to regulations like HIPAA. The computer displaying it is an off-the-shelf asset, but its *access* to the unique data makes its security critical.
*   `üö© Further Research/Clarification Needed:` Explore formal methodologies for asset valuation in cybersecurity risk assessments (e.g., Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment).

*   `üîë **Main Takeaway:** Identifying and valuing assets (hardware, software, data) based on replaceability and importance is fundamental to knowing what needs protection in information security.`

    *   *Malicious vs. Non-Malicious Threats:* IDS vs. Backup procedures.
    *   *Directed vs. Non-Directed Threats:* Threat intelligence vs. General firewall rules.

### **5.2. Functional Types of Controls**

![[Pasted image 20250428231556.png]]

*   **1. Prevention Controls:** Stop an incident from occurring.
    *   *Internal Prevention:* User Authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Permissions.
    *   *External Prevention:* Firewalls, VPNs, Anti-Malware, Network Segmentation.

### **5.3. Attack Requirements: Method, Opportunity, Motive (MOM)**
For an attack to succeed, the attacker typically needs:

*   **Method:** The skills, tools, knowledge, and techniques required to perform the attack.
*   **Opportunity:** The time and access needed to exploit a vulnerability.
*   **Motive:** The reason or goal driving the attack (e.g., financial gain, espionage, disruption).
*   **Note:** **Denying any one of these three factors can prevent or thwart an attack.** Controls often aim to eliminate or reduce one or more of these.
*   `üß† Mnemonic:` Think **MOM** ‚Äì an attacker needs all three to succeed.

### **5.4. Methods of Defense (Control Strategies)**
These align with the functional types of controls:

1.  **Prevent:** Block the attack or fix the vulnerability (e.g., patching, strong authentication).
2.  **Deter:** Make the attack harder or less attractive (e.g., warnings, visible security).
3.  **Deflect:** Redirect the attack (e.g., honeypot).
4.  **Mitigate:** Reduce the impact if an attack succeeds (e.g., backups, incident response).
5.  **Detect:** Identify the attack occurring or after the fact (e.g., IDS, logs).
6.  **Recover:** Restore systems and data after an attack (e.g., backups, DRP).

### **5.5. Effectiveness of Security Controls**
Controls are only effective if:

1.  **Awareness of the Problem:** Users and administrators understand the risks.
2.  **Likelihood of Use:** Controls are **easy, efficient, and practical** (users won't bypass overly cumbersome security).
3.  **Layered Security (Defense in Depth):** Multiple, overlapping controls are implemented (no single point of failure).
4.  **Periodic Reviews:** Controls are regularly reviewed, tested, and updated.

*   `üö© Further Research/Clarification Needed:` Explore specific control frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO 27001.
*   `üìù Potential Exam Question:` Explain the concept of "Defense in Depth" and provide an example of how multiple control types (technical, administrative, physical) could be layered to protect a sensitive database server.

*   `üîë **Main Takeaway:** Controls are essential defenses categorized by CIA goal, implementation type, and function (prevent, detect, etc.). Effective security uses layered controls (Defense in Depth) and considers the attacker's Method, Opportunity, and Motive (MOM).`

*   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating people to bypass security controls or divulge sensitive information (e.g., phishing, pretexting).

*   **Quote:** "**Security is an ongoing process requiring continuous improvement and adaptation.**"

---

## **7. Fundamentals of Encryption**

*   **Purpose:** Encryption transforms readable data (**Plaintext**) into an unreadable format (**Ciphertext**) to protect it from unauthorized parties.
*   **Problems Addressed:** Helps prevent attackers who might try to:
    *   **Intercept (Eavesdrop):** Read the message content.
    *   **Modify:** Alter the message content without detection (when combined with integrity checks).
    *   **Fabricate:** Create fake messages appearing authentic (when combined with authentication).
    *   *(Note: Encryption alone doesn't prevent blocking/interruption, which affects Availability).*

### **7.1. Encryption Terminology**

*   **Plaintext:** The original, readable message or data.
*   **Ciphertext:** The encrypted, unreadable (scrambled) message or data.
*   **Encrypt / Encode / Encipher:** The process of converting plaintext to ciphertext.
*   **Decrypt / Decode / Decipher:** The process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext.
*   **Algorithm (Cipher):** The mathematical rules or procedures used for encryption and decryption.
*   **Key:** A piece of secret information (like a password) used by the algorithm to encrypt or decrypt. The security of most modern systems relies on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm.
*   **Cryptosystem:** The complete system including the algorithm, key(s), and procedures for use.
*   **Sender:** The entity transmitting the message.
*   **Recipient:** The intended receiver of the message.
*   **Transmission Medium:** The channel used for communication (e.g., internet, radio waves).
*   **Interceptor / Intruder / Attacker:** An unauthorized party attempting to access/modify the message.

### **7.2. Encryption/Decryption Process**

*   `[VISUAL: Diagram showing: Plaintext -> ENCRYPT (using Key) -> Ciphertext -> TRANSMIT -> Ciphertext -> DECRYPT (using Key) -> Plaintext]`
1.  **Encryption:** `Ciphertext = Encrypt(Key, Plaintext)`
2.  **Decryption:** `Plaintext = Decrypt(Key, Ciphertext)`

### **7.3. Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption**

*   **1. Symmetric Encryption (Secret Key Cryptography):**
    *   Uses the **same single key** for both encryption and decryption.
    *   **Key must be kept secret** and shared securely between sender and recipient beforehand.
    *   **Advantages:** Very **fast** and efficient. Good for encrypting large amounts of data.
    *   **Disadvantages:** **Secure key distribution** is a major challenge. The number of keys needed grows rapidly with the number of users (`n*(n-1)/2` keys for `n` users).
    *   **Examples:** **DES, 3DES, AES**, RC4, Blowfish.
*   **2. Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Cryptography):**
    *   Uses a **pair of mathematically related keys:** a **Public Key** and a **Private Key**.
    *   **Public Key:** Can be shared freely with anyone. Used to encrypt data or verify signatures.
    *   **Private Key:** Must be kept **strictly secret** by the owner. Used to decrypt data or create signatures.
    *   **How it works:** Data encrypted with the public key can *only* be decrypted with the corresponding private key (and vice-versa in some algorithms).
    *   **Advantages:** Solves the **key distribution problem** (public keys can be shared openly). Enables **digital signatures** for authentication and non-repudiation.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Much **slower** than symmetric encryption (thousands of times slower).
    *   **Examples:** **RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), Diffie-Hellman** (key exchange).

| **Symmetric Key Encryption**                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Asymmetric Key Encryption**                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## **8. Cipher Types and Cryptographic Principles**

### **8.1. Stream Ciphers vs. Block Ciphers**

*   **1. Stream Ciphers:**
    *   Encrypt data **one bit or one byte at a time**.
    *   Often use a pseudorandom keystream XORed with the plaintext.
    *   **Suitable for:** Real-time communication where data arrives continuously (e.g., voice calls, video streaming).
    *   **Examples:** RC4 (dated), ChaCha20, A5/1 (GSM).

![[Pasted image 20250428233550.png]]

*   **2. Block Ciphers:**
    *   Encrypt data in **fixed-size blocks** (e.g., 64 bits for DES, 128 bits for AES).
    *   Plaintext is padded to a multiple of the block size if necessary.
    *   Operate in different *modes* (e.g., ECB, CBC, CTR) to handle multiple blocks securely.
    *   **Suitable for:** Encrypting files, database fields, network packets where data size is known or can be buffered.
    *   **Examples:** **DES, AES**, Blowfish, Twofish.

![[Pasted image 20250428233557.png]]



### **8.2. Core Cryptographic Principles: Diffusion & Confusion**
These concepts, introduced by Claude Shannon, are essential for making ciphers resistant to cryptanalysis.

*   **1. Diffusion:**
    *   **Goal:** To **spread the influence of plaintext bits** over many ciphertext bits. Hides statistical patterns in the plaintext.
    *   **How it works:** Changing a single plaintext bit should ideally change roughly half the ciphertext bits (Avalanche Effect). Achieved through permutations (shuffling bits).
    *   **Effect:** Makes it difficult for attackers to find relationships between plaintext and ciphertext.
*   **2. Confusion:**
    *   **Goal:** To **obscure the relationship between the ciphertext and the key**.
    *   **How it works:** Makes the encryption process highly non-linear using complex substitutions.
    *   **Effect:** Makes it hard to deduce the key even if an attacker has large amounts of plaintext/ciphertext pairs. Achieved through substitution boxes (S-Boxes).

*   `üß† Mnemonic:` **D**iffusion **S**preads (plaintext influence). **C**onfusion **C**onceals (key relationship).

### **8.3. Stream vs. Block Cipher Comparison**

![[Pasted image 20250428233536.png]]

| Feature           | **Stream Ciphers**                     | **Block Ciphers**                            |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Advantages**    | ‚úÖ **Fast**                             | ‚úÖ **High Diffusion** (good mixing)           |
|                   | ‚úÖ Low error propagation (bit errors don't spread far) | ‚úÖ More resistant to insertions/modifications |
| **Disadvantages** | ‚ùå **Low Diffusion** (simpler mixing)   | ‚ùå **Slower** than stream ciphers           |
|                   | ‚ùå Vulnerable to modifications (if keystream reused) | ‚ùå Error propagation (in some modes)        |
|                   |                                        | ‚ùå Requires padding for partial blocks        |

*   `üìñ Glossary:`
    *   **Stream Cipher:** Encrypts data bit-by-bit or byte-by-byte.
    *   **Block Cipher:** Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks.
    *   **Diffusion:** Spreading plaintext influence across ciphertext.
    *   **Confusion:** Obscuring the relationship between ciphertext and key.
    *   **Avalanche Effect:** Small change in input (plaintext/key) causes large change in output (ciphertext).

*   `üîë **Main Takeaway:** Ciphers can process data as streams (bit-by-bit, fast) or blocks (fixed chunks, better diffusion). Strong ciphers rely on Diffusion (spreading plaintext effect) and Confusion (hiding key relationship) to resist attacks.`

## **9. Data Encryption Standard (DES)**

*   **Type:** **Symmetric block cipher**.
*   **History:** Developed by IBM in the 1970s, adopted as a standard by **NIST** in **1976**.
*   **Specifications:**
    *   Operates on **64-bit blocks** of plaintext/ciphertext.
    *   Uses a **56-bit key** (originally 64 bits, but 8 are parity bits and ignored).
*   **Current Status:** **Considered insecure and obsolete** due to the small key size, making it vulnerable to modern **brute-force attacks**.

### **9.1. DES Variants**

| Form                   | Operation                                     | Effective Key Size | Strength vs. DES              | Notes                                          |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **DES**                | Encrypt (K1, P)                               | **56 bits**        | Baseline (Weak)               | Vulnerable to brute-force.                     |
| **Double DES (2DES)**  | Encrypt (K2, Encrypt(K1, P))                  | **112 bits**       | ~ Doubled (Not \(2^{112}\)) | Vulnerable to **Meet-in-the-Middle attack** (~ \(2^{57}\) effort). Not widely used. |
| **Two-key Triple DES (3DES)** | Encrypt(K1, Decrypt(K2, Encrypt(K1, P))) (E-D-E) | **112 bits**       | **~ \(2^{80}\) security** (16M x DES) | Common variant. K1 used twice.                 |
| **Three-key Triple DES (3DES)** | Encrypt(K3, Decrypt(K2, Encrypt(K1, P))) (E-D-E) | **168 bits**       | **~ \(2^{112}\) security** (72 Quintillion x DES) | Most secure DES variant.                       |

*   **Security Concerns:**
    *   **DES:** Broken easily.
    *   **3DES:** Slower than modern ciphers like AES. Also being deprecated due to vulnerabilities (e.g., Sweet32 attack on 64-bit block ciphers).
    *   **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** The **recommended modern replacement**.

### **9.2. DES Structure and Process**

![[Pasted image 20250428233642.png]]

*   `[VISUAL: Diagram showing DES encryption/decryption using the same 56-bit key]`
*   **Overall Structure:** Uses a **Feistel Network** structure.
    1.  **Initial Permutation (IP):** Rearranges the bits of the 64-bit input block according to a fixed table. Purely transposition, no cryptographic value itself. `[VISUAL: Table showing IP bit mapping]`
    2.  **16 Rounds of Processing:** Each round performs substitution and permutation.
    3.  **Final Permutation (FP):** The inverse of the Initial Permutation. Rearranges bits back. `[VISUAL: Table showing FP bit mapping]`

*   **Key Schedule:**
    *   The initial 56-bit key is used to generate **16 different 48-bit subkeys (round keys)**, one for each round.
    *   Involves permutations (PC-1, PC-2) and circular shifts of key halves.
    *   `[VISUAL: Diagram illustrating the key schedule process: 56-bit Key -> PC-1 -> Split C0/D0 -> 16 rounds of (Left Shift + PC-2 -> 48-bit Round Key)]`

### **9.3. DES Rounds and Feistel Cipher**

![[Pasted image 20250428233721.png]]

*   **Structure of Each Round (i = 1 to 16):**
    1.  **Input:** The 64-bit block from the previous round (or IP), split into Left half \(L_{i-1}\) (32 bits) and Right half \(R_{i-1}\) (32 bits).
    2.  **Apply Round Function (f):** The function \(f\) takes \(R_{i-1}\) and the 48-bit round key \(K_i\) as input and produces a 32-bit output.
    3.  **XOR:** The output of \(f(R_{i-1}, K_i)\) is XORed with the Left half \(L_{i-1}\).
    4.  **Swap:** The original \(R_{i-1}\) becomes the new Left half \(L_i\). The result of the XOR becomes the new Right half \(R_i\).
        *   \(L_i = R_{i-1}\)
        *   \(R_i = L_{i-1} \oplus f(R_{i-1}, K_i)\)
    5.  **Exception:** The **swap is *not* performed** after the final round (Round 16). (Alternatively, some diagrams show a swap after round 16 followed by another swap immediately after, effectively cancelling out). `[VISUAL: Diagram clarifying the final round swap handling]`

*   **Decryption:** Uses the same algorithm but applies the round keys \(K_{16}, K_{15}, ..., K_1\) in reverse order. The Feistel structure makes this possible.

### **9.4. The DES Function (f)**

![[Pasted image 20250428233756.png]]
*   **Purpose:** Provides the core **confusion and diffusion** within each round. Operates on the 32-bit Right half \(R_{i-1}\) using the 48-bit Round Key \(K_i\).
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Expansion (P-Box):** Expands the 32-bit \(R_{i-1}\) to **48 bits** using a fixed **Expansion Permutation (E)** table. Bits are rearranged and some are duplicated. 
    ![[Pasted image 20250428234030.png]]

    3.  **Key Mixing (Whitener):** The 48-bit output from E-Box is **XORed** with the 48-bit **Round Key \(K_i\)**.
    4.  **Substitution (S-Boxes):** The 48-bit result is divided into **eight 6-bit blocks**. Each block goes into a corresponding **Substitution Box (S-Box)** (S1 to S8).
        *   Each S-Box is a lookup table that takes a **6-bit input** and produces a **4-bit output**.
        *   **Input interpretation:** The 1st and 6th bits determine the **row** (0-3). The middle 4 bits determine the **column** (0-15).
        *   The 8 S-Boxes produce a total of \(8 \times 4 = 32\) bits.
        *   **Crucial Step:** S-Boxes are the **only non-linear element** in DES and provide **confusion**. Their design is critical to DES's security (though concerns were raised).
   ![[Pasted image 20250428233837.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250428233845.png]]
    4 .  **Permutation (P-Box)**: The resulting 32 bits from the S-Boxes are rearranged using a fixed Permutation (P) table. This provides diffusion.

### **9.5. DES Examples and Strength**

*   **S-Box Calculation Examples:**

![[Pasted image 20250428234128.png]]
    *   *Input `100011` to S-Box 1:* Row `11` (3), Col `0001` (1) -> Output `12` (`1100`)
 If we write the first and the sixth bits together, we get 11 in binary, which is 3 in decimal. The remaining bits are 0001 in binary, which is 1 in decimal. We look for the value in row 3, column 1, in Table 6.3 (S-box 1). The result is 12 in decimal, which in binary is 1100. So the input 100011 yields the output 1100. 

*   Input `000000` to S-Box 8:* Row `00` (0), Col `0000` (0) -> Output `13` (`1101`)
If we write the first and the sixth bits together, we get 00 in binary, which is 0 in decimal. The remaining bits are 0000 in binary, which is 0 in decimal. We look for the value in row 0, column 0, in Table 6.10 (S-box 8). The result is 13 in decimal, which is 1101 in binary. So the input 000000 yields the output 1101.

*   **Strength Analysis:**
    *   **Key Size (56 bits):** Main weakness. \(2^{56}\) keys (\(7.2 \times 10^{16}\)). Brute-force is feasible: cracked in months (1997), days (1998), hours (1999).
    *   **Analytic Attacks:**
        *   **Differential Cryptanalysis:** Exploits how input differences affect output differences. DES S-Boxes were designed to resist this (largely successful). Requires large amounts of chosen plaintext.
        *   **Linear Cryptanalysis:** Uses linear approximations of the S-Boxes. Can break DES with \(2^{43}\) known plaintexts (less practical than brute-force).
    *   **Timing Attacks:** Exploit variations in computation time based on key/data. Relevant for implementations (e.g., on smartcards), not the algorithm itself.

### **9.6. DES Weaknesses**

*   **Design Weaknesses:**
    *   Some potential (though debated) weaknesses in S-Box / P-Box design choices.
    *   **Weak Keys (4 keys):** Keys where \(E_K(E_K(P)) = P\). Encryption is the same as decryption. ![[Pasted image 20250428234635.png]]
    *   **Semi-Weak Keys (6 pairs = 12 keys):** Key pairs (K1, K2) where $(E_{K1}(E_{K2}(P)) = P\). One key encrypts what the other decrypts.
    *   **Possible Weak Keys (48 keys):** Keys generating only two distinct round keys.
    *   **Probability:** Chance of randomly picking any of these 64 keys is minuscule (\(64 / 2^{56} \approx 8.8 \times 10^{-16}\)). Implementations should check for and reject them.
    ![[Pasted image 20250428234500.png]]
*   **Key Complement Property:**
    *   If \(C = E(K, P)\), then \(C' = E(K', P')\), where `'` denotes bitwise complement.
    *   **Effect:** Reduces the effective brute-force search space from \(2^{56}\) to \(2^{55}\), halving the work.

*   `üìñ Glossary:`
    *   **DES (Data Encryption Standard):** Obsolete 64-bit symmetric block cipher with 56-bit key.
    *   **Feistel Network:** Cipher structure where data is split, processed in rounds with swaps. Allows using the same algorithm for encryption/decryption.
    *   **Round Key (Subkey):** Key derived from the main key, used in a specific round.
    *   **Key Schedule:** Algorithm generating round keys from the main key.
    *   **IP/FP (Initial/Final Permutation):** Bit rearrangement steps in DES.
    *   **E-Box (Expansion P-Box):** Expands 32 bits to 48 bits in DES function.
    *   **S-Box (Substitution Box):** Non-linear lookup table providing confusion in DES (6-bit input, 4-bit output).
    *   **P-Box (Permutation):** Bit shuffling providing diffusion in DES function.
    *   **Brute-Force Attack:** Trying every possible key.
    *   **Meet-in-the-Middle Attack:** Attack applicable to double encryption schemes like 2DES.
    *   **Differential/Linear Cryptanalysis:** Advanced analytical attacks exploiting cipher properties.
    *   **Weak Key:** A key causing undesirable cryptographic behavior (e.g., encryption = decryption).
    *   **Key Complement Property:** Relationship between encryption with a key and its complement in DES.
    *   **3DES (Triple DES):** Applying DES three times with 2 or 3 keys for stronger security (now also deprecated).

*   `üîë **Main Takeaway:** DES is a foundational but now insecure 64-bit block cipher with a 56-bit key, based on a Feistel structure. Its small key size makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. While its internal design (S-Boxes) resisted early analytic attacks well, it has known weaknesses (weak keys, complement property) and is superseded by AES.`

## **10. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**

*   **Type:** **Symmetric block cipher**.
*   **History:** Developed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen (Belgian cryptographers) as "Rijndael". Selected by **NIST** in **2001** after an open competition to replace DES.
*   **Usage:** **Current global standard**, widely used in hardware and software (e.g., WPA2/WPA3 Wi-Fi security, TLS/SSL, file encryption).
*   **Specifications:**
    *   Fixed **block size of 128 bits**.
    *   Variable **key lengths: 128, 192, or 256 bits**.
    *   Number of **Rounds** depends on key length: 10 (128-bit key), 12 (192-bit key), 14 (256-bit key).
    *   Uses **Substitution-Permutation Network** structure (unlike DES's Feistel network).

---

## **11. Public Key (Asymmetric) Cryptography**

*   **Concept:** Uses **two mathematically related keys** per user instead of one shared secret key.
    *   **Public Key:** Shared openly with anyone.
    *   **Private Key:** Kept strictly secret by the owner.
*   **Asymmetry:** The key used for encryption is different from the key used for decryption.
*   **Foundation:** Based on difficult mathematical problems (e.g., factoring large numbers, discrete logarithms).
*   **Role:** **Complements**, rather than replaces, symmetric cryptography.

### **11.1. How Public-Key Cryptography Works**

*   **Confidentiality (Encryption):**
    *   Sender encrypts the message using the **Recipient's Public Key**.
    *   Only the **Recipient** can decrypt the message using their **Private Key**.
![[Pasted image 20250428234829.png]]
*   **Authentication/Digital Signatures:**
    *   Sender "signs" a message (or its hash) by encrypting it with their **own Private Key**.
    *   Anyone can verify the signature by decrypting it with the **Sender's Public Key**. If successful, it proves the message came from the sender and wasn't altered.
    *   `[VISUAL: Diagram showing digital signature: Sender -> Sign (Own Private Key) -> Signature -> Verify (Sender's Public Key) <- Recipient]`

### **11.2. Secret Key vs. Public Key Comparison**


| Feature             | **Secret Key (Symmetric)**     | **Public Key (Asymmetric)**                     |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Number of Keys**  | 1 (Shared Secret)            | 2 per user (**Public** & **Private**)           |
| **Key Protection**  | Must keep the shared key secret | Must keep **Private Key** secret; Public key is open |
| **Key Distribution**| **Major challenge** (secure channel needed) | **Easy** (Public keys can be shared openly)   |
| **Speed**           | **Fast**                     | **Very Slow** (100x - 10,000x slower)           |
| **Primary Uses**    | **Bulk data encryption** (Confidentiality) | **Key Exchange, Digital Signatures, Authentication** |
| **Key Size**        | 128-256 bits (AES)           | 2048 bits or more (RSA), 256+ bits (ECC)        |

### **11.3. Why Public-Key Cryptography?**

*   **Solves Key Distribution:** Eliminates the need for pre-shared secret keys via insecure channels. Enables secure communication between parties who have never met.
*   **Enables Digital Signatures:** Provides **authenticity** (proof of origin), **integrity** (proof of no modification), and **non-repudiation** (sender cannot deny sending).
*   **History:** Publicly introduced by **Whitfield Diffie & Martin Hellman** (1976), though known earlier in classified communities (e.g., GCHQ in the UK). A **major cryptographic advancement**.

### **11.4. Public-Key Characteristics**

*   **Security:** Computationally **infeasible** to derive the Private Key from the Public Key.
*   **Efficiency:** Encryption and decryption are (relatively) **easy** *if* you have the correct key.
*   **Reversibility (sometimes):** \( D_{Private}(E_{Public}(M)) = M \) and \( D_{Public}(E_{Private}(M)) = M \). This property enables both confidentiality and digital signatures with algorithms like RSA. 

### **11.5. Public-Key Applications**

1.  **Encryption/Decryption (Confidentiality):** Encrypt message with recipient's public key.
2.  **Digital Signatures (Authentication, Integrity, Non-repudiation):** Sign hash with sender's private key.
3.  **Key Exchange:** Securely establish a shared secret key (typically for *symmetric* encryption) over an insecure channel. (e.g., Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or encrypting a symmetric key with the recipient's public key).

*   `[Brief Summary]:` Often, asymmetric crypto is used to securely exchange a *symmetric* key (due to speed), and then the faster symmetric crypto is used for the bulk data encryption (Hybrid Approach).

### **11.6. Public Key for Secret Key Exchange (Hybrid Cryptosystem)**

*   Steps
    1.  Alice wants to send an encrypted message to Bob.
    2.  Alice generates a random **session key** (for symmetric encryption, e.g., AES).
    3.  Alice encrypts the session key using **Bob's Public Key**.
    4.  Alice encrypts her actual message using the **session key** (symmetric encryption).
    5.  Alice sends the encrypted session key and the encrypted message to Bob.
    6.  Bob decrypts the encrypted session key using his **Private Key**.
    7.  Bob uses the recovered session key to decrypt the actual message.

*   `üåç Real-World Example:` TLS/SSL (used in HTTPS) uses asymmetric cryptography during the initial handshake to authenticate the server and securely exchange session keys, then uses symmetric encryption for the actual web traffic.

*   `üìñ Glossary:`
    *   **Public Key Cryptography (Asymmetric):** Uses public/private key pairs.
    *   **Public Key:** Shared key for encryption or signature verification.
    *   **Private Key:** Secret key for decryption or signing.
    *   **Digital Signature:** Encrypted hash providing authenticity, integrity, non-repudiation.
    *   **Key Exchange:** Process of establishing a shared secret key.
    *   **Diffie-Hellman:** A key exchange algorithm (not for encryption/signatures itself).
    *   **RSA:** Common algorithm for both encryption and digital signatures.
    *   **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography):** More efficient alternative to RSA, providing same security with smaller key sizes.
    *   **Hybrid Cryptosystem:** Combines asymmetric crypto (for key exchange/signatures) with symmetric crypto (for bulk data).

*   `üîë **Main Takeaway:** Public key (asymmetric) cryptography uses public/private key pairs to solve key distribution and enable digital signatures, complementing faster symmetric encryption, often used together in hybrid systems.`

## **12. Ensuring Data Integrity and Authenticity**

### **12.1. Error Detecting Codes**
Used to detect accidental modifications during transmission or storage.

*   **Simple Codes:**
    *   **Parity Checks:** Detect single-bit errors. Simple, limited.
    *   **Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC):** Detect common burst errors caused by noise. Used in networking (Ethernet) and storage. Not cryptographically secure.
*   **Cryptographic Integrity Codes:** Designed to detect *intentional* modifications.
    *   **One-Way Hash Functions (Cryptographic Hash Functions):** See below.
    *   **Cryptographic Checksums / MACs:** Hash functions combined with a secret key.
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Asymmetric cryptography applied to hashes.

### **12.2. (Cryptographic) Hash Functions**

*   **Purpose:** Create a fixed-size "fingerprint" or **message digest** of arbitrary-size input data.
*   **Properties:**
    *   **One-way:** Computationally infeasible to find the input data given only the hash output.
    *   **Deterministic:** Same input always produces the same output hash.
    *   **Collision Resistant:** Computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.
    *   **Avalanche Effect:** Small change in input results in a large, unpredictable change in the output hash.
*   **Use:** Verify data integrity. If the hash of received data matches the original hash, the data hasn't been altered.
*   **Examples:** **SHA-256, SHA-3**, MD5 (broken), SHA-1 (weakened).

### **12.3. Digital Signatures (Revisited)**

*   **Definition:** A cryptographic mechanism used to verify the **authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation** of digital data.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Sender:** Computes the **hash (message digest)** of the document/message.
    2.  **Sender:** Encrypts the hash using their **Private Key**. This encrypted hash is the **digital signature**.
    3.  **Sender:** Sends the original document + the digital signature.
    4.  **Receiver:** Decrypts the signature using the **Sender's Public Key** to recover the original hash (Hash A).
    5.  **Receiver:** Computes the hash of the received document independently (Hash B).
    6.  **Verification:** If **Hash A == Hash B**, the signature is valid (authentic sender, data unmodified).
![[Pasted image 20250428235238.png]]

*   `üîó Connections:` Digital signatures combine hash functions (for integrity) with asymmetric cryptography (for authenticity and non-repudiation).

*   `üìñ Glossary:`
    *   **Error Detecting Code:** Algorithm to detect accidental data errors.
    *   **Parity Check:** Simple error detection for single bit errors.
    *   **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):** Common error detection for burst errors.
    *   **Hash Function (Cryptographic):** Creates a fixed-size, one-way digest of data for integrity checks.
    *   **Message Digest:** The output of a hash function.
    *   **Collision Resistance:** Property of hash function making it hard to find two inputs with the same hash.
    *   **Digital Signature:** Encrypted hash using sender's private key, ensuring authenticity, integrity, non-repudiation.

*   `üîë **Main Takeaway:** Cryptographic hash functions create unique data fingerprints for integrity checks. Digital signatures combine hashes with asymmetric encryption to prove who sent the data and that it wasn't tampered with.`

## **13. Certificates and Trust Infrastructure**

### **13.1. Certificates: Binding Identity to Keys**

*   **Problem:** How do you trust that a public key actually belongs to the person/entity claimed?
*   **Solution:** **Digital Certificate**.
*   **Definition:** A **digital certificate** is an electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a **Public Key** with an **Identity** (information such as name, organization, email address).
*   **Issuer:** Certificates are issued and digitally signed by a trusted third party called a **Certificate Authority (CA)**.


### **13.2. Certificate Authority (CA)**

*   **Role:** A trusted entity that **verifies the identity** of individuals or organizations before issuing a certificate.
*   **Trust Anchor:** Users' systems (browsers, OS) typically have a pre-installed list of trusted **Root CAs**.

### **13.3. Certificate Signing and Hierarchy (Chain of Trust)**

*   CAs can be organized hierarchically. A Root CA can issue certificates for Intermediate CAs, which can then issue certificates for end-entities (like websites or users).
*   **Verification:** To verify a certificate, the system checks the signature of the issuing CA. If that CA is not a Root CA, it checks the certificate of the *issuing* CA, following the chain up until a trusted Root CA is reached.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Edward (Root CA)** signs **Diana's (Intermediate CA) certificate**.
    *   **Diana** signs **Delwyn's (End-entity) certificate**.
    *   Delwyn's certificate is presented. To trust it, the system verifies Diana's signature using Diana's public key (found in *her* certificate). Then, it verifies Diana's certificate using Edward's public key (trusted Root CA).

![[Pasted image 20250428235333.png|500]]

*   `üåç Real-World Example:` When you visit an HTTPS website, your browser verifies the website's SSL/TLS certificate by checking the signature chain back to a trusted Root CA stored in your browser/OS.

*   `üìñ Glossary:`
    *   **Digital Certificate:** Document binding a public key to an identity, signed by a CA.
    *   **Certificate Authority (CA):** Trusted entity that issues and signs certificates.
    *   **Root CA:** Top-level CA trusted implicitly by systems.
    *   **Intermediate CA:** CA whose certificate is signed by another CA.
    *   **Chain of Trust:** Hierarchical relationship of certificates back to a Root CA.
    *   **SSL/TLS Certificate:** Certificate used to secure website communication (HTTPS).

*   `üîë **Main Takeaway:** Digital certificates, issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), solve the problem of trusting public keys by securely binding them to verified identities, forming a chain of trust.`

---

## **14. Web Security Example: HTTPS and Browser Tracking**

*   **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** Uses SSL/TLS to encrypt communication between browser and web server.
    *   Provides **Confidentiality** and **Integrity** for web traffic.
    *   Uses certificates for server **Authentication**.
    *   **Limitation:** While encrypting *content*, HTTPS **does not inherently prevent tracking** based on *metadata* or browser characteristics.
*   **Browser Fingerprinting:** Websites can identify and track users (even across sessions) by collecting a unique combination of browser/system attributes (e.g., installed fonts, screen resolution, browser plugins, OS version, time zone). This can occur even over HTTPS.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Tools like the **"HTTPS Everywhere"** browser extension help enforce HTTPS connections, reducing opportunities for some passive network eavesdropping but not directly stopping fingerprinting.
    *   Other techniques (VPNs, Tor Browser, privacy-focused browsers, disabling scripts) can help reduce fingerprinting.
*   `üö© Further Research/Clarification Needed:` Explore specific browser fingerprinting techniques and more advanced countermeasures (e.g., Canvas Fingerprinting, AudioContext Fingerprinting).
