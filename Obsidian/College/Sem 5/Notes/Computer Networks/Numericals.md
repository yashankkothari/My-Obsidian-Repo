### Checksum

Checksum is created at senders side
Checksum is validated at receivers side
#### Checksum Operations at Sender Side

#### Checksum Example
![[{E3E06A06-8553-46D2-AFFB-F8E5EC1AC427}.png]]

After dividing it into parts we need to add them all up

![[{165D13EB-51EB-46F2-837B-46F084EAB2C0}.png]]

in this example we have got **10** as the carry but we cant keep it there so we have to add it to the overall answer we got so it'll be

Now we will do 1's compliment of the below number that we get
![[{7FDB9B18-8CBD-4E36-9178-19A1D94E61A2}.png|700]]

After we get the checksum, it is added to the beginning of the data that we want to transmit

Now the sender part is over

#### Checksum Operations at Receiver Side

lets assume that the receiver is receiving the same data block without any errors

![[Numericals 2024-09-24 01.51.56.excalidraw|700]]

if the result is all 1, the receiver will accept it as there are no transmission errors

### CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)

#### CRC Generation at Sender Side

Since our divisor ha L=4 (length of divisor is 4)
we will do step 2
L-1=3 so we will append 3 0's to the original message

==**your number should always start with a 1, if it starts with a 0 you need to do an XOR operation with 0**==

![[Numericals 2024-09-24 02.05.14.excalidraw]]

==Your Final remainder will be the CRC==

#### Polynomial to Divisor Conversion
![[{B1BF2EC2-E549-47DA-A2A3-0B4A5658DF4E}.png|300]]

If the polynomial is given and you want to do a binary division, you can use this conversion
#### CRC From Receiver

lets take the same example : 100100001 is the received message

your divisor will remain the same which is 1101 which is taken from the polynomial given

now just perform division 

![[{D426F4F9-E948-4F70-8C46-310C0C1B806D}.png]]

since the remainder is all 0s the receiver can conclude that the data is right
